# Blitz Script

* A work in progress script interpreter made by me :D

* This is still a heavy w.i.p. so expect bugs and stuff (I'm learning C while making this lol)

* This is windows only btw, sorry mac and linux users :P

* Feel free to suggest stuff to add

* Check out the Examples folder and Examples.md to learn how to use Blitz Script!

```
