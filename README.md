# Blitz Script

* A work in progress script interpreter made by me :D

* This is still a w.i.p. so expect bugs and stuff (I'm learning C/C++ while making this lol)

* Some commands are restricted to windows oonly (I'll prob try add a device detection thingy)

* Feel free to suggest stuff to add

* Check out the Examples folder and Examples.md to learn how to use Blitz Script!

# How to build

```bash
cd src
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
